# Obsolete, officially integrated into Debian Buster
No need to use this repository anymore, netatalk-3.1 was integrated into Debian Buster.
https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=690227 is fixed, please get your netatalk
package directly from Debian.

This repository is only here for historical purposes and may eventually be deleted. It is
completely unmaintained, unlike the official Debian package.
