  * Add Vcs-Svn and Vcs-Browser fields to debian/control.
  * Move Homepage to own field (from pseudo-field in long description).
  * Update CDBS tweaks:
    + update-tarball needs cdbs 0.4.39 or newer (only relevant for
      backports).
    + Fix typo in update-tarball regarding gzip-recompressing tarballs.
    + Use uppercase variables in copyright-check.
  * Update build-dependency cosmetics in debian/rules, and semi-auto-
    update debian/control:
      DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=cdbs-autoupdate fakeroot debian/rules pre-build
  * Support Zeroconf (instead of SLP:
    + Add patches 107 and 108 to support zeroconf, found at
      http://aur.archlinux.org/packages/netatalk/netatalk/ .
    + Enable zeroconf, and build-depend on recent version of libavahi-client-dev.
    + Drop SLP support, and drop build-depending on libslp-dev and recommending
      slpd.
    + Unfuzz zeroconf patches.
  * Generate autotools at build time (zeroconf patches change autobuilt files).
    + Disable patches to autobuilt files.
    + Adjust patch 210 to not indent comment hashes, thanks to automake 1.10.
    + Duplicate macros directory as m4, and touch AUTHORS, ChangeLog and INSTALL
      (as workaround for cdbs lacking support for passing options to autotools).
    + Suppress copyright-checking autobuilt files.
    + Build-depend on libltdl3-dev (seems to grow a dependency on that once the
      source has been rebuilt once).
  * Build-depend on libkrb5-dev (not heimdal-dev). Closes: bug#441520.
  * Add patch 109 to support explicitly avoiding XFS quota support. Patch found at
    http://aur.archlinux.org/packages/netatalk/netatalk/ . Use it - code is
    broken currently (complains about redefining __swabXXX in xfs/swab.h).
  * Only enable PGP UAM when SSL is enabled (didn't fail but was confusing).
  * Update BerkeleyDB linkage:
    + Add patch 110 to fix linking against newer versions of BerkeleyDB, found at
      http://aur.archlinux.org/packages/netatalk/netatalk/ .
    + Extend patch 110 to avoid deprecated DB_VERB_CHKPOINT.
    + build-depend on libdb-dev (not libdb4.2-dev).

netatalk (2.0.3-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Update CDBS tweaks:
    + Replace auto-update.mk with overloading buildcore.mk.
    + Add debian/README.cdbs-tweaks and advertise it in debian/rules.
    + Fix applying buildinfo only once.
    + Fix race condition: check copyright strings in pre-build target
      (not clean target).
    + Add upstream-tarball.mk to implement get-orig-source target.
  * Declare (and cleanup) build-dependencies in debian/rules.
  * Semi-auto-update debian/control:
      DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=cdbs-autoupdate fakeroot debian/rules pre-build
  * Add patch 212 to disable cnid_metad by default. This was the only
    major change in -5 initscript and thus hopefully closes: bug#384276.

netatalk (2.0.3-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Change back to unversioned build-dependency on heimdal-dev again

    + 101_fix_manpage_sed_replacements.patch
    + 208_fix_manpage_sed_replacements_for_automade_file.patch
  * Add patches to make upstream sysv init-file behave sanely:

    + 103_initscript_background_off_by_default.patch
    + 104_initscript_load_module_only_if_intended.patch

    + 210_avoid_update-rc-d.patch
    + 211_avoid_update-rc-d_for_automade_file.patch
  * Add debian/patches/README explaining the patch numbering scheme.
  * Enable the use of upstream Debian-compliant init-file:
    + SysV daemons honours locale defaults.
    + SysV script handles new cnid daemon.
  * Have debhelper reinstall init-file, adding maintainer script hooks.
  * Rename NEWS.Debian to NEWS in source to get recognized by debhelper
    (yes, seems odd, but that's how it works).
  * Recommend procps, needed by macusers.
  * Fix default UAM list (upstream assumes openssl is compiled in).
  * Improve use of cdbs:
    + Add local snippet copyright-check.mk: Scan source for (c) changes.
    + Add local snippet auto-update.mk: auto-update build-dependencies.
      (enabled only when environment includes DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=update).
    + Add local snippet buildinfo.mk: Include env info with binary pkgs
    + (instead of invoking buildinfo directly within debian/rules).
    + Switch to using patchsys-quilt (instead of simple-patchsys).
  * Add comments documenting the various parts of debian/rules, and
    avoid indentation, to not show them during build.
  * Fix my entry as package uploader.
  * Add netatalk_update.sh (found on upstream wiki) as example script.
  * Support autobuilding of ssl-enabled packages when DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS
    contains "ssl":
    + Include ssl-related build-dependencies with cdbs auto-update (when
      environment contains DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=update,ssl or similar).
    + Extend default UAM list handling to toggle SSL-enabled UAMs.
    + Safety-check: Refuse to build if build-depending on "libssl" but
      without "ssl" included in DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS (if auto-updated to
      use ssl but later incosistently built without it enabled).
  * Update note in README.Debian about unofficial ssl-enabled packages
    to refer to new netatalk-only repository:
    deb http://debian.jones.dk/ $DIST/netatalk main
  * Bump up standards-version to 3.7.2 (no changes needed).
  * Drop no longer relevant (pre-potato) dependencies:
    - Depended on libpam-runtime (>= 0.76-14).
    - Conflicted with libatalk1 and netatalk-dev.
    - Replaced libatalk1.

  * New upstream release. Security fix: insecure tempfile handling
    (CAN-2004-0974). Closes: bug#278396 (thanks to Joey Hess
    <joeyh@debian.org>).
  * Recommend db4.2-utils and add new patch 206 adapting hardcoded paths
    in cnid_maint to Debian location of helper binaries. Closes:
    Bug#239347 (thanks to Rory Campbell-Lange
    <rory@campbell-lange.net>).
  * Improve init script:
    + Timelord requires Appletalk, so load only when ATALKD_ON=yes.
    + Use && instead of test -a (it is apparently not POSIX compliant).
  * Cleaned up debian/copyright:
    + Mention "GNU systems" (instead of only GNU/Linux).
    + Drop info contained in changelog.
    + Refer only to upstream source. Closes: Bug#260703 (thanks to Adam
      Glasgall <teferi@wmute.net>).
    + Use simpler upstream source URL: http://netatalk.sourceforge.net/.
  * Improve README.Debian section on SSL being disabled:
    + Rephrase to describe only _current_ state (NEWS.Debian is the
      place for _change_ of state).
    + Rephrase to clarify the FSF and Debian as _interpreting_ the
      conflict between licenses (could be seen as FSF and Debian being
      the authors of OpenSSL license).
    + Clarify the FSF abbreviation.
    + Describe how to rebuild locally with SSL support.
    + Add another possible source of SSL-enabled packages, and clarify
      that both sources are only unofficial _suggestions_. Closes (also)
      bug#260703 (thanks to Adam Glasgall <teferi@wmute.net>).

      "DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=ssl" at build time.
      - Include cracklib-support to PAM config on ssl build.

    generated binary files and not really meant for changing anyways - a
    mapping is a mapping is a mapping.)
  * debian/netatalk.docs: removed file BUGS.

netatalk (1.5.1.1-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Use uams_dhx.so and uams_randnom.so. This will enable SSL support by
    default.
  * Fixed wrong line breaks in AppleVolumes.system. Pointed out by Jonas.

netatalk (1.5.1.1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Offically re-enabled OpenSSL support. Rationale: In the OpenSSL FAQ[1]
    it says:

      2. Can I use OpenSSL with GPL software?

      On many systems including the major Linux and BSD distributions, yes (the
      GPL does not place restrictions on using libraries that are part of the
      normal operating system distribution).

    Also, Debian does not infringe on the copyright of the Netatalk team,
    since we (the Netatalk team) clearly intend Netatalk to be linked
    against OpenSSL. (OpenSSL support is on by default.)

    OpenSSL support was on by accident since a few version back anyways.
    Now removed the part about enabling OpenSSL support from README.Debian
    and added appropriate build dependencies.

netatalk (1.5.1.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added conflict with bigloo for now. This partly addresses bug
    #132041. (Both, netatalk and bigloo contain a binary with the name
    afile.) We need to fix this properly by ending the ugly name space
    pollution of afile.

netatalk (1.5.1.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * Added -q flag to grep call in init file to suppress spurious output.
    (Suggestion by Aubin Paul.)
  * The init script is now able to start AppleTalk daemons in the background.
    (See /etc/default/netatalk.) This was a much-requested feature and we
    can also remove the patches to netatalk.conf and its man page. And -
    most importantly - it fixes a four-figure and a "wontfix" wishlist bug!

      hope that Jonas' patch can go upstream.
    + 014_--sysconfdir_is_included_with_--enable-fhs
      Remove --sysconfdir from ./configure flags.
  * Fix segfault at startup on PowerPC. Thanks to David D. Kilzer for the

  * Upstream does now have manpages for apple_cp(1), apple_mv(1), and
    apple_rm(1), written by Lance Levsen <l.levsen@printwest.com>.
    Removed the links to undocumented(7).

    + 012_logcheck_corrections
  * Also "fixed" uams_dhx_pam.so. (Closes: #120360)

netatalk (1.5pre8-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed uams_pam.so. (Closes: #118889)
  * Explain why we don't link against OpenSSL in README.Debian.
  * Modified debian/rules so that setting a variable called USE_SSL to
    "yes" enables SSL support. This should ease the local compilation of
    SSL-enabled netatalk packages.

    + 005_visible_home_dir_in_config_(again!)
      Name user home directories "Home Directory" by default to make them
      appear in the MacOS chooser. (Patch had already been applied in
      1.5pre7-2, but had been lost since.)
    + Jonas made more patches, which I haven't applied yet, but either
      committed upstream or sent upstream for discussion.

      Name user home directories "Home Directory" by default to make them
      appear in the MacOS chooser.
    + 007_logcheck
      Support for the logcheck log file checking package.
    + 011_avoid_symlinks_and_force_using_autoconf_2.50
      Partly applied: Patch configure.in so that the use of autoconf 2.50
      is forced. (Debian autoconf hack workaround.)
    + 012_netatalk.conf
      Improved init script. Also, make use of netatalk.conf again.
      I patched the patch so that netatalk.conf is placed in /etc/default.

      Partly applied: Enable cracklib support.
  * Fixed paths in add_netatalk_printer.
  * Removed lp2pap.sh since it's of no use on Debian systems.
  * Removed test_parse_mtab and afpd-mtab.pl because we are not using
    the mtab DID scheme.
  * Comparison operator is '=', not '==' in the 'test' command. Fixed
    my patch.
  * Removed netatalk.conf.5 as well, since we don't install netatalk.conf
    anymore.
  * Removed superfluous file /etc/netatalk/netatalk.pamd.
  * Moved all *.la and *.a files to netatalk-dev. Added appropriate
    conflicts and replaces.

netatalk (1.5pre7-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream version. Most patches were applied upstream.
  * This release uses libtool for UAM stuff. Also, the correct flag
    for dynamic linking is supplied, so the problems with unresolved

  * Non-DSFG free code was removed. Copyright notice was changed accordingly.
  * Use ./configure --sysconfdir instead of --with-config-dir.
  * Upstream package does now install PAM file in the correct directory.
    Removed rule, correcting this from Debian rules file.
  * Added man pages for netatalk-config(1) and timelord(8). (Upstream
    does now also include a man page for timeout(1), but since we're not

  * Use debhelper compatibility level 3 and performed general packaging
    cleanups at the same time.
  * Standards-Version 3.5.6.0. No changes needed.

netatalk (1.4b2+asun2.0a18.2-1) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * New "upstream" release.
  * This does add new features, however, it also fixes at
    least one nasty bug (Bug#13973).
  * Applied patch which adds a command-line option to disable
    CR/LF translation (thanks to Davide Welton and Jon Nelson).
    (Note to release manager: this patch is applied so this
     package has the exact functionality of netatalk-asun)
  * Renamed libatalk-dev to libatalk1-dev.
  * Symlinked /usr/man/man1/nbpunrgstr.1.gz to /usr/man/man1/nbprgstr.1.gz
    to keep lintian happy.
  * Changed the "lock directory" to /var/run and the names of the "lock files" to <foo>.pid,
    since what the source calls locks are really the same as the .pid files other daemons
    put in /var/run.
  * This package provides all the functionality of netatalk-asun, and
    it will replace netatalk-asun in the distribution.

  * Changed comment in /etc/AppleVolumes.default (Bug:#15279)

  * Added a kluge to /etc/init.d/netatalk to remove kernel appletalk
    module (if there is one) at stop and reinsert it at start, this
    is needed or else netatalk will not start once stopped (Bug:#12142,11349)

 -- Joel Klecker <jk@espy.org>  Fri, 30 Jan 1998 07:50:00 -0800

netatalk (1.4b2-4.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Non-maintainer libc6 compile.

 -- Joel Klecker <jk@espy.org>  Tue, 6 Jan 1998 00:00:00 -0800

netatalk (1.4b2-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Recompiled against newer PAM libraries.
  * Added /etc/pam.d/samba.

 -- Klee Dienes <klee@debian.org>  Sat, 8 Mar 1997 01:17:09 -0500

netatalk (1.4b2-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added PAM support.
  * Split into libatalk, libatalk-dev, and netatalk.
  * Added patch from Randy Gobbel <gobbel@cogsci.ucsd.edu> to allow case
    translation to be specified at config-time rather than compile time.
    Note that configuration files that make use of this feature may not
    work with other releases of netatalk, and that this feature may be
    removed in the future if UMich rejects the patch or implements it
    differently.
  * Startup messages now conform to 'Standard for Console Messages' (fixes
    #5399).
  * No longer creates new subdirectories (to appease dpkg-buildpackage).

 -- Klee Dienes <klee@debian.org>  Wed, 26 Feb 1997 21:02:02 -0500

netatalk (1.4b2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Resend_request made external for libnatali.
  * Added shared libraries.
  * Next revision will split into libatalk, libatalk-dev, and netatalk.

 -- Klee Dienes <klee@debian.org>  Fri, 24 Jan 1997 22:37:22 -0500

netatalk (1.4b2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Updated to upstream version 1.4b2.
  * Added preliminary PAM support (currently disabled).
  * Made /etc/init.d/netatalk a conffile.
  * Changed /etc/init.d/netatalk to complete only once appletalk services
    are running.  Configurating an Appletalk interface can take many (> 15)
    seconds, so the previous version would fork a process to configure the
    interface and then start up the other Appletalk services.  Although
    possibly controversial, this change is necessary so that packages like
    ppr can be ensured that netatalk will be started before they run
    without undue complication.

 -- Klee Dienes <klee@debian.org>  Sat, 2 Nov 1996 19:42:04 -0700
